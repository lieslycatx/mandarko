    <description lang="en">Sends a WOL magic packet to a remote computer using its ethernet MAC address and displays a notification if and when the computer is available.
    	
The Addon can be launched manually from the Programs-section of XBMC (and thus added to your favourites, etc.), and can also be configured to autostart with XBMC, thus waking up your remote computer when XBMC starts.

Additionally another command (e.g. activate a specific window) can be handed to the script as a parameter. It then launches that command either immediately or not until the remote computer is available. Behaviour can be set by a second parameter:
- False: launch immediately (default)
- True: wait for remote computer

As an example, you could add the following entry to your favourites.xml:
&quot;RunScript(&quot;quot;script.advanced.wol&quot;quot;,ActivateWindow(MyVideoLibrary),True)&quot;
This would attempt to wake the remote computer configured in the &quot;Advanced Wake On Lan&quot;-Settings, wait until it is awake, and only then launch the XBMC-Video-Library.

This feature is expecially useful, if you want to launch your remote computer, when entering a specific menu-item in XBMC.</description>
    <disclaimer lang="en">Uses XBMC-builtin-command &quot;WakeOnLan&quot; to send the wakeup-packet, and the GNU-licensed &quot;python-ping&quot;-script to determine the status of the server. Please see the file &quot;ping.py&quot; for infos on the latter one.</disclaimer>
